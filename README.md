 # R-P-S Nucleur
R-P-S Nucleur is an online web game. The rules of the game are straightforward, the gameplay follows Rock, Paper, Scissors with a secret 'Nucleur' option hidden within. Players can choose tro challenge the computer or to challenge a friend. Paterns of three options, either Rock, Paper or Scissors, are compared to determin the winner of each 'Round' of the patern. Points are awarded to the winning party, a draw will not award any points, the highest score one can achieve is three points. in the games current format, players are expected to predetermine the end point, ie First to 10 points or similar as the game 'loop' can be ran endlessly with points from previous games carried forward. The game has good potential for further development, it features a classic flash game kind of design style with a retro appearance. This game given its simplicity would likely see most use in a classroom 'fun lesson' type environment, but would be appropriate for anybody searching for a digital Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

The fourth option, 'Nucleur' has been intentionally hidden within the sight, to give options to play the game in the regular original format, and to withold the strength of the option from new players given that chosing this option shall end the round and award exactly 1 point only to the relevant player.

## Features 

Below is a detailed explanantion of the various features built into the website, along with some additonal features that could be implemented further down the road. 

### Existing Features

- __Main Menu__

  - The naviagtion bar appears on all three pages, the styling is identical across the site to provide familiarity to the user. The title of the website itself is a link to the landing page, a common choice that helps users find their way when lost. The bar is repsonsive, the page you are hovering over shall highlight a bright shade of yellow and appear underlined.
  - This feature allows users to comfortably and quickly navigate across the various pages, no matter their device type or current location. 

![Navigation Bar and page title](https://github.com/WHLW27/HTML-Essentials-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/assets/images/readme/navbar.png)

- __PVP Game Type__

  - This section shows some text either side of an iframe dispalying a video courtesy of the National Geogrpahic Youtube channel. The video is a snip from an episode of Ancient Aliens focusing on Gobekli Tepe. Either side of the video are boxes of text containing some more factual information sourced from online resources. 
  - The user will find this area valuable as it contians a broad range of information on Gobekli Tepe and introudces some theories and hypothesis surrounding the temples history. This may work well to capture the users interest. This video works well to introduce the Temple from a more 'alternative history' perspective, where as the text content is a more academic, factual resource. Providing both the hard facts and the fun.

- __PVPC Game Type__

  - The first call to action is a button that asks the user a rhetorical question, are they interested? If the answer is yes the user will click this button, at which point they will be taken to the articles page of the site, from this area they can research and potentially purchase a book.
  - This button has value in capturing the user, drawing them further into the site. If this site was built to receive some kind of commission via users purchasing a book through the links on the articles page, this would be a very important feature, enabling that commission stream. If this project was developed further, this call to action could take the user to our own online store. 

![Additonal reading](https://github.com/WHLW27/HTML-Essentials-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/assets/images/readme/ctaone.png)

- __Score Chart__

  - The gallery area of the landing page acts almost as a 'Plan B' perhaps the user was interested in the initail content, but not particularly in the Gobekli Tepe Temple itself. Perhaps they are a student or teacher researching the topic of Ancient Temples. Well Gobekli Tepe was a great place to start, being the oldest known temple in the world. The gallery shows images of this temple giving users more context and encouraging their imaginations. Along with the images is a second Call-to-action button, which when clicked, shall navigate users to the timeline page of the website. On this page they can find addiitonal information and visual representations of the following 8 oldest temples in the world. Each icon on the timeline is an anchor that will open that temples relevant wikipedia page in a second tab.
  - As stated above, the images provide the usr with more context on the subject of focus, Gobekli Tepe. The images of both night and day, various angles and notable discoveries at the sight of Gobekli Tepe feed the users imagination as they begin to construct a mental-picture of the sight. This should draw them further into the content of the webpage, the call to action then locks on to this intrigue and directs it towards the timeline page. If this project was developed further, this timeline would work as an interective learning resource for students, teachers and amateur historians alike. From this area you can find some basic information on various temples and visual representations of them all, which act as links to the relevant wikipedia entries. These could be developed into links for various seperate webpages built into the website itself, featuring content similar to that of the landing page instead of directing the user away to a potential competitor. These seperate pages could have intergration with travel estores, allowing the user to search local holidays, flights and excursions at each of these historical sights. A additional opportunity to build in a commission stream of some kind.

- __Playing Area__ 

  - In this section of the page, which is featured across the whole website, the user can find 3 useful links. A link that will load the wikipedia database of the oldest known buildings in the world, a link that will open the amazon store's search results for Gobekli Tepe and a final link that will load the youtube search results again for Gobekli Tepe. All three links open in a seperate tab and are designed to point the user in the direction of additional external resources.
  - The value in these links is that users can digest the content of the project, then be placed in some of the best locations to find additional information on the topic of focus, Gobeklit Tepe and ancient structures. Students and Teachers would find this section of most use, if the website was compared to a disseration, the footer would be the 'foot notes' providing the user with external resource to provide additional context to their understanding of the topic.

- __Patern Comparison Area__

  - The timeline shows in order, images of the 8 oldest temples aside from Gobekli Tepe. The images will 'pop' when the viewer hovers their cursor over the image. This switch in appearance may prompt the viewer to click the image, opening a second window to the temples relevant wikipedia page for additonal reading. 
  - Users may find this area valuable should they wish to apply further context to their learning, or if the topic of ancient temples in general is of particular interest to them.

### Potential features to Implement

- Impliment a game option to chose a finite number of rounds such as 'best of 3' or 'first to 10 points'.

- 'Quick Fire Mode' with no paterns, only one round.
- An interactive main menu, the will allow users to set all game options via toggles rather than seperate buttons. 
- Enhacements through animations on the score counter, better audio, original artworks and imagery added to the styling. 

## Testing 

Below is a detailed explanation of the testing and deployment process of this project.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator, all HTML code from script.js functions have also been validated through this service - https://validator.w3.org/
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- JavaScript
  - No relevant errors were found when passing through the official JSHint Linter - https://jshint.com/

### Unfixed Bugs

Regarding the Div's that build the various timeline 'panels'. I had difficulty making the text bold and highlighted whilst keeping the background image's opacity to generate a clear contrast. I struggled to find a clear method to address this through just CSS and HTML and decided it would be best to place the text alongside the image instead of on top.  

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the Main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
