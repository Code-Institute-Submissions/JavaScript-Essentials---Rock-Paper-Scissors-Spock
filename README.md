 # R-P-S Nucleur
R-P-S Nucleur is an online web game. The rules of the game are straightforward, the gameplay follows Rock, Paper, Scissors with a secret 'Nucleur' option hidden within. Players can choose tro challenge the computer or to challenge a friend. Paterns of three options, either Rock, Paper or Scissors, are compared to determin the winner of each 'Round' of the patern. Points are awarded to the winning party, a draw will not award any points, the highest score one can achieve is three points. in the games current format, players are expected to predetermine the end point, ie First to 10 points or similar as the game 'loop' can be ran endlessly with points from previous games carried forward. The game has good potential for further development, it features a classic flash game kind of design style with a retro appearance. This game given its simplicity would likely see most use in a classroom 'fun lesson' type environment, but would be appropriate for anybody searching for a digital Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

The fourth option, 'Nucleur' has been intentionally hidden within the sight, to give options to play the game in the regular original format, and to withold the strength of the option from new players given that chosing this option shall end the round and award exactly 1 point only to the relevant player.

## Features 

Below is a detailed explanantion of the various features built into the website, along with some additonal features that could be implemented further down the road. 

### Existing Features

- __Main Menu__

  - When first landing on the website, you'll see a clear and simple Main menu taking the form of a selection of buttons. This iteration of the game features two game types which can be accessed by selecting the relevant button on the screen. These being the PVP (Player vs Player) Game type, P VS Computer (Player vs Computer) Game Type. This menu sits beneath the banner featuring the games title. This banner carries across all areas of the game.
  - Beneath the two game type options are Manuals featuring helpful information on how to navigate through either game type. 
  - This area gives master access to all areas of the game, those external locations also root back to this menu, allowing for smooth and seamless navigation throughout.

- __PVP Game Type__

  - This section shows some text either side of an iframe dispalying a video courtesy of the National Geogrpahic Youtube channel. The video is a snip from an episode of Ancient Aliens focusing on Gobekli Tepe. Either side of the video are boxes of text containing some more factual information sourced from online resources. 
  - The user will find this area valuable as it contians a broad range of information on Gobekli Tepe and introudces some theories and hypothesis surrounding the temples history. This may work well to capture the users interest. This video works well to introduce the Temple from a more 'alternative history' perspective, where as the text content is a more academic, factual resource. Providing both the hard facts and the fun.

- __PVPC Game Type__

  - The first call to action is a button that asks the user a rhetorical question, are they interested? If the answer is yes the user will click this button, at which point they will be taken to the articles page of the site, from this area they can research and potentially purchase a book.
  - This button has value in capturing the user, drawing them further into the site. If this site was built to receive some kind of commission via users purchasing a book through the links on the articles page, this would be a very important feature, enabling that commission stream. If this project was developed further, this call to action could take the user to our own online store.

- __Score Chart__

  - The score chart will appear in both the PVP and P VS Computer game types, in PVP Player One and Player Two can use this scoreboard to change and set their player name for the game. These names can be carried into new games. The scoreboard also efficiently records and reflects the scores in points for the two players. In the P VS Computer game type, only the name for player one can be altered, the scoreboard will instead reflect the scores for the Computer
  - This is a crucial tool for the gameplay. This records the winners of each of the three rounds in each overall game, then awards points up to a maximum of three to the winning party. Players can predetermine the end goal, such as first to 10 points, this scoreboard allows for these points to be recorded.

- __Playing Area__ 

  - In this section of the page, which is featured across the whole website, the user can find 3 useful links. A link that will load the wikipedia database of the oldest known buildings in the world, a link that will open the amazon store's search results for Gobekli Tepe and a final link that will load the youtube search results again for Gobekli Tepe. All three links open in a seperate tab and are designed to point the user in the direction of additional external resources.
  - The value in these links is that users can digest the content of the project, then be placed in some of the best locations to find additional information on the topic of focus, Gobeklit Tepe and ancient structures. Students and Teachers would find this section of most use, if the website was compared to a disseration, the footer would be the 'foot notes' providing the user with external resource to provide additional context to their understanding of the topic.

- __Patern Comparison Area__

  - This box will display the input chosen by both player one (P1) and player two (P2) to allow users to check the results themselves, in the P VS Computer game type, players can see their own choices alongside the patern randomly generated by the computer. 
  - This tool allows the players to compare the paterns or to compare against the computer to reinforce the results of the game. 

![Timeline](https://github.com/WHLW27/HTML-Essentials-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/assets/images/readme/timline.png)

- __Play Again / Main Menu Buttons__

  - At the bottom of the game area are two buttons, one of them sits inside the playing window, this option will fire up the next game whilst carrying the previous scores and chosen player names forward. The other button 'Main Menu' shall reset the game and return players to the landing screen, main game menu.
  - The play again button will give players the option to carry on the scoring, perhaps they are playing first to 10 points? A maximum of 3 points can be awarded per round so this option carries forward any chosen player names and current scores into fresh games.
  - The main menu button will allow players to return to the main menu, whilst resetting the player names, current scores and chosen paterns. Effectively resetting the game itself whilst providing straightforward site navigation.

### Potential features to Implement

- Impliment a game option to chose a finite number of rounds such as 'best of 3' or 'first to 10 points'.
- 'Classic Mode' with only the three original options.
- 'Quick Fire Mode' with no paterns, only one round.
- An interactive main menu, the will allow users to set all game options via toggles rather than seperate buttons. 
- Enhacements through animations on the score counter, better audio, original artworks and imagery added to the styling. 

## Testing 

Below is a detailed explanation of the testing and deployment process of this project.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/), all HTML code from script.js functions have also been validated through this service.
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- JavaScript
  - No relevant errors were found when passing through the official [JSHint Linter](https://jshint.com/).

### Unfixed Bugs

Regarding the Div's that build the various timeline 'panels'. I had difficulty making the text bold and highlighted whilst keeping the background image's opacity to generate a clear contrast. I struggled to find a clear method to address this through just CSS and HTML and decided it would be best to place the text alongside the image instead of on top.  

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
  - Once the Main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
